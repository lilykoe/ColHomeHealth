	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>Columbine Home Health was founded in 1997 by three local nurses who had lived and worked in the Roaring Fork Valley for 35 years. The nurses believed that Home Health Care should be non-profit with the resources being returned to the community. Therefore, a non-profit was formed for the purpose of providing traditional home health care as well as senior wellness clinics, and indigent care. More than 5,000 elderly and disabled adults have received home health services since Columbine Home Health, Inc was founded. The three founding nurses are still heavily involved with the agency and they now have 17 years of experience providing home health care and complying with Medicare and Medicaid regulations and, more recently Colorado state licensure. The agency has excellent State surveys and receives patients referrals from many sources throughout the state.

	<h3>Comment from one of our founding nurses</h3>
	<p>"Sarah, Heather and I, created Columbine Home Health Inc, because we wanted to give back to our local community by serving the pioneers of the area. We did some soul searching and decided to start our own nonprofit home health agency where we could keep our integrity and maintain our commitment to our patientsâ€™ needs. Our goal is to keep seniors and disabled adults in their homes and out of institutions as long as they can safely remain at home, while maintaining the highest quality of health care possible." ~ Kim Oliver,<br>
Co-founder and current CFO</p><br><br>
